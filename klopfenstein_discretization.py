        Return the reflection of the Klopfenstein taper.
        To do so, the taper impedance is discretised in n sections.
        Each of these sections is modeled as a lossless transmission line.
        At the end the LJPA is modeled as a lumped element to ground and very
        high impedance (1e99 ohm) to the line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        f : float
            Signal frequency in GHz.
        z_ext : float
            Impedance seen by the pumpistor at the idler frequency
        ll : np.ndarray
            Inductance per unit length along the taper length in henry per meter
        cl : np.ndarray
            Capacitance per unit length along the taper length in farad per meter
        n : float
            Number of discret elements used to model the taper line.
        l : float
            Length of the taper in meter
        zl : float
            Load impedance
        as_theory : bool
            If true use the load impedance of the characteristic impeance
            calculation to try to mimic the theoritical reflection.
            Use this parameter to test if this method can correctly mimic
            the theoritical expectation.
